You and me we made a vow <br>
For better or for worse<br>
I can`t believe you let me down<br>
But the proof is in the way it hurts<br>

For months on end I`ve had my doubts<br>
Denying every tear<br>
I wish this would be over now<br>
But I know that I still need you here<br>

You say I`m crazy<br>
Cause you don`t think I know what you`ve done<br>
But when you call me baby<br>
I know I`m not the only one<br>

you've been so unavailable<br>
Now sadly I know why<br>
Your heart is unobtainable<br>
Even though Lord knows you kept mine<br>

You say I`m crazy<br>
Cause you don`t think I know what you`ve done<br>
But when you call me baby<br>
I know I`m not the only one<br>

I have loved you for many years<br>
Maybe I am just not enough<br>
You`ve made me realize my deepest fear<br>
By lying and tearing us up<br>

You say I`m crazy<br>
Cause you don`t think I know what you`ve done<br>
But when you call me baby<br>
I know I`m not the only one<br>

You say I`m crazy<br>
Cause you don`t think I know what you`ve done<br>
But when you call me baby<br>
I know I`m not the only one<br>
I know I`m not the only one<br>
I know I`m not the only one<br>
And I know and I know and I know and I know<br>
And I know and I know..<br>
I know I`m not the only one
